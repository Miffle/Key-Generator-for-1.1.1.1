# Key-Generator-for-1.1.1.1
This is a key generator that collects keys for VPN 1.1.1.1 (WARP+) for 12 million gigabytes. Because if you haven't changed anything, it may be that there will be a void after the screensaver for a long time. This is normal, the generator picks up the keys and most often they are 1 GB, it remains to wait. To see all the keys, you can uncomment 3 lines (78 - 80). It doesn't work indefinitely (I'm too lazy to do it), but you can change the limit (increase/decrease)
